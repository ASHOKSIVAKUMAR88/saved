When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
This procedure assumes you have already created a repository on GitHub, or have an existing repository owned by someone else you'd like to contribute to.
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click Clone or download. 
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click 
to copy the clone URL for the repository. 
Open Terminal.
Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
